# EEG Emotion Detection

## Overview

This project involves emotion detection using EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. The goal is to classify emotions based on EEG signals using a machine learning model. The code provided in this repository performs data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `emotion_detection.py`: Contains code for preprocessing data, training the model, evaluating the model, and plotting graphs.
- `emotion_detection_model.h5`: Trained machine learning model for emotion detection (generated after running the training script).

## Installation

To set up the project environment, install the required Python packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
